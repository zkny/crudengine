# crudengine
Crudengine is a program to help us to get rid of boilerplate programing. The goal of this is to shorten the time it takes us to get our things done. Define the schema and boom we can move to the frontend and worry about other things.


## For crudengine see the readme in the backend folder, for vue-crudengine see the frontend folder
